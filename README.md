# Language-detection.python
*To detect the language in text with the help of libraries like
langdetect.
* This parses through the basic functions of langdetect library and is going to detect the sentence
of a language.
* Langdetect library consists of array of language codes.
* It supports 55 languages of the box.
* Language detection algorithm is non-deterministic, which means that if you try to run it on a
text which is either too short or too ambiguous, you might get different results every time you
run it.
* Different languages have different in-built codes to identify the language.
* Data presentation must be easy to understand so the developer, as well as the user, can make
an efficient implementation of the operation.
